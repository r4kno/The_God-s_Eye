# The God's Eye

An advanced AI-powered surveillance and threat detection system that combines computer vision, object detection, and hardware automation for real-time monitoring and response.

## 🎯 Overview

The God's Eye is an intelligent surveillance system that uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning models to detect persons and weapons in real-time through webcam input. When a threat is identified (person holding a weapon), the system provides audio alerts and can interface with Arduino-controlled hardware for automated tracking and response.

## ⚡ Key Features

- **Real-time Person Detection**: Uses YOLOv8m pre-trained model for highly accurate human detection
- **Custom Weapon Detection**: Employs a custom-trained YOLOv8n model specifically for weapon identification
- **Threat Assessment**: Automatically identifies when a person is holding a weapon and triggers threat alerts
- **Audio Announcements**: Text-to-speech alerts for detected objects and threats
- **Arduino Integration**: Hardware control for automated tracking and targeting systems
- **Distance Estimation**: Calculate approximate distance to detected persons
- **Multi-Model Detection**: Simultaneous detection of multiple object classes

## 🛠️ System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Computer Vision Engine**: YOLO-based object detection models
2. **Audio System**: TTS-based announcement system using gTTS and pygame
3. **Hardware Interface**: Serial communication with Arduino for motor control
4. **Tracking System**: Real-time object tracking and coordinate calculation
